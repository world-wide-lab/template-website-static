# Citizen Science Website Template

This repository contains a template to create your own citizen science website with World-Wide-Lab.

## Using the Template

### Step 1: Creating your own repository

1. Click the `Use this template` button on the top-right of this repository page.
2. Select `Create a new repository`.
3. Fill in the details for your new repository. Ideally set the visibility of the repository to `Public`.
4. Click Create repository from template.

### Step 2: Going online

1. In your repository on GitHub, go to the `Settings` tab.
2. On the left-hand side, go to `Pages` (under `Code and automation`).
3. Set the **Source** to `Deploy from branch`.
4. Set the **Branch** to `main` and `/ (root)`.
5. Click `Save`.
6. Go to the `Actions` tab, there should be a new *pages build and deployment* action.
7. Wait for the action to complete and click it. It should have a link to the URL under which your site is now visible.
8. Optional: You can also [specify a custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) for your website.

Your citizen science website should now be online! ✨️

### Step 3: Modifying the template

Add your own citizen science studies in the [`studies/`](./studies/) directory (or adjust the existing ones) and modify the root [`index.html`](./index.html) and [`config.js`](./config.js) so that the information is correct.
